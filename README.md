# Overview

I began my programming journey about 10 years ago now, but have never published anything publicly.  As this is my first foray after some time away from programming to focus on other pursuits, I felt it fitting to begin where all programmers begin, with Hello_World.

Included is a small, old joke just for fun.  Well, not super old, but it is as old as Vine.

# Development Environment

For this project I utilized VSCode, having previously used Visual Studio for much of my coding projects.  I have enjoyed its interface, as well as Intellisense for assistance catching typos.

C++ was the first programming language I learned, and so I felt it fitting to return to my old friend before branching out into the newer frontiers of languages and frameworks and more.
